## Zero
A simple game engine written in C++ that will use the Qt GUI framework. 
This game engine is being developed as a learning exercise and the use of third party libraries 
(including Qt APIs) will be kept to a minimum. 

## Build
The engine is built using cmake and follows the Qt cmake setup process. 

## Development
Currently working on the math module
